Yes, we truly have no minimum order quantity. You can order as few as 1 piece, and we treat every order with the same level of attention.

## Why No MOQ is Possible

### 1. AI-Driven Manufacturing
- **Automated Setup**: AI reduces setup time from hours to minutes
- **Smart Scheduling**: Single pieces integrated into batch production efficiently
- **Cost Optimization**: AI finds the most economical production methods
- **Flexible Capacity**: Dynamic resource allocation based on order mix

### 2. Digital Manufacturing Model
- **Paperless Process**: Digital workflows eliminate administrative overhead
- **Automated Quality**: Reduced QC costs per piece
- **Smart Inventory**: Just-in-time material sourcing
- **Virtual Prototyping**: Reduce physical prototyping needs

## Single Piece Manufacturing Benefits

### For Prototyping
- **Quick Validation**: Test designs before committing to larger quantities
- **Design Iteration**: Make improvements based on physical samples
- **Cost Control**: Only pay for what you need to test
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Accelerate product development cycles

### For Production
- **Demand-Based Manufacturing**: Produce exactly what you need
- **Inventory Reduction**: Eliminate excess inventory costs
- **Cash Flow Improvement**: Lower upfront investment requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce exposure to design changes
