Our AI manufacturing system is a complete intelligent process chain, driven by AI from blueprint analysis to finished product delivery.

## AI Process Planning Workflow

### 1. Smart Blueprint Parsing
```
CAD Upload → AI Geometry Recognition → Feature Extraction → Manufacturability Analysis
- Automatically recognize 200+ geometric features
- Detect potential manufacturing challenges
- Generate manufacturability assessment report
```

### 2. Process Path Optimization
- **Material Analysis**: AI identifies material properties, recommends optimal cutting parameters
- **Tool Selection**: Smart matching from 1000+ tool library
- **Machining Sequence**: Calculate optimal machining paths, reduce setup changes
- **Parameter Setting**: Automatically set spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut, etc.

### 3. Quality Prediction & Control
- **Simulation Verification**: Virtual machining preview, predict quality issues
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Real-time parameter adjustment during machining
- **Defect Warning**: Early detection of quality risk points
